# linuss-crystal

Advent of code implementation in Crystal.

## Installation

[Install crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/docs/installation/)
make spec
make

## Usage

./linuss-crystal -h
./linuss-crystal -1 spec/aoc1_example.txt

If you plan to run the full specs, then it is good to add --release
to the spec command because it is slow otherwise due to AoC5.
