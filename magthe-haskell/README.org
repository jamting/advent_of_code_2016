These are my solutions to Advent of Code 2016, written in Haskell.

* Preparations

1. Ensure ~stack~ is installed. Just follow the instructions for your OS/distro/... at [[https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/][The Haskell Tool Stack]].
2. Change into this directory and run the command =stack setup= followed by =stack install --dependencies-only=.

Both of these steps may take a few minutes to finish.

* To run

On OSs that supports it all solution files are marked as executable:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
./Part1.hs input
#+END_SRC

On other OSs it's necessary to run it using ~stack~:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
stack Part1.hs input
#+END_SRC

* Input to solutions

Almost all solutions accept on the command line a file that is expected to contain the input, e.g. see the examples above. All solutions print the result to standard out.

The exceptions to this are

| December 5  | Takes the door ID as command line argument                            |
| December 11 | Takes no input, instead it's hardcoded into the source                |
| December 13 | Takes the office designer's favourite number as command line argument |
| December 14 | Takes the salt as command line argument                               |
| December 16 | Takes the input as command line argument                              |
